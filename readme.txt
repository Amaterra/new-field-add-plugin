== Description ==

    A plugin that, upon activation, creates a new field called "Promotion Tag" in the WooCommerce product editing card. 
After activation, you can enter any value into the field, which will be saved upon updating the product and will be available 
for editing in the "Promotion Tag Field" tab. This tab includes a WooCommerce product filter by category and availability, 
and a list of products with their names, categories, prices, availability, and promotion tags.

There is also a text input field for entering a new promotion tag and a "Update Promotion Tag" button. 
When selecting the checkbox next to a product, entering text in the input field, and clicking the "Update Promotion Tag" button, 
the promotion tag will be updated for all selected products. Additionally, there is a "Select All" button that allows 
you to choose all products in the list.


== Installation ==

 After downloading the archive, extract it and place the "new-field-add-plugin" folder into the WordPress files directory, 
following this path: wp-content -> plugins. Once the "new-field-add-plugin" folder is moved into the "plugins" folder, 
refresh the WordPress plugins page and activate the plugin. Upon activation, a new field will appear in the 
WooCommerce product editing section and a new tab will be added to the WordPress admin panel.
